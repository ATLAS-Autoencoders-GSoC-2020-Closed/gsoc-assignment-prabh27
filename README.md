# ATLAS Autoencoders Project 
Create an autoencoder to compress sample files.

Prepare an autoencoder to compress the files in the dataset in this folder:

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JaCB-prsDhEX4Ovk-UjC9bMxOHbpfREr?usp=sharing

from 4 to 3 variables.

You can take inspiration from the scripts and notebooks in this repository, as the project will be starting from those:

https://github.com/Skelpdar/HEPAutoencoders

If you use the material in this repository, you don't necessarily need to train the network as you will already find a ready-made network in the folder (but you can still use the scripts and train the available network if you want, and there are both training and testing datasets).

Produce plots of the difference between original and uncompressed variables for each entry of the dataset, divided by the original variable. You can also add other plots (eg reconstruction loss).
